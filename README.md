# Rizz++ -> A Lang simple like python and fun like Genz slangs

*Tired of the same old boring programming languages?*
Say hello to a fresh Gen-Z flavored language ðŸš€ â€” built entirely in C++ with a clean, Python-like syntax (but guess whatâ€¦ no annoying indentation rules).

This isnâ€™t just a language for one dev â€” itâ€™s a community project. Contribute, experiment, and help it grow. Letâ€™s build something iconic together

## Docs

### variables

Simple syntax while declaring variables no need to assign types to it jus tgive them value and start vibing.

```rizz
a= 10
b=10
bruh a + b
```

### Print 
To print just write *bruh* and whatever you want to print

```rizz
bruh "Let's vibe"
```
### Comments

TO comment a line just use // in front of the the statement

```rizz
//this just a comment
a=10
bruh=10
```

### arthematic operations

this language also supports all kind of arthematic operations 

```rizz
result = (dawg + nigger) * 3;
bruh result
```

### Taking Input

To take input of value ( right now only available for string , int & float ) just write *spill* and varname next to it.

```rizz
spill name
bruh name
```

### Conditional statemtents

This language also supports the control flow statements with if elseif and else.

*bet* -> if , *noFam* -> elseif , *forReal* -> else , *yikes* -> to close conditional block.

```rizz
a=10

bet x<5:
  bruh "Brotha the number is less than 5"
noFam x==9:
  bruh "Maann the number is 9 , no stress"
forReal:
  bruh "let it go bruh"
yikes
```

### Function declaration and call

TO use functions in Rizz++ , you gotta use *drip* keyword with function name following it , and if you want you can pass arguments to it if required
to close the function use *finna* keyword 
```rizz
drip compare(x,y):
    bruh "This function starts here"
    bruh x >= y
    bruh x <= y
    z = no_cap
    bruh !z
    bruh !cap
    bruh -x
finna

compare(x,y)
```
